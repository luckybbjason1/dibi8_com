# PM-Skills: 68 Product Management Skills and 42 Workflows for AI Agents

TL;DR — **PM-Skills Marketplace** is an open-source collection of 68 product management skills and 42 chained workflows across 9 plugins, designed for Claude Code, Cowork, and 50+ other AI assistants. From discovery to strategy, execution, launch, growth, and shipping AI-built code — it encodes proven PM frameworks from Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, Alberto Savoia, and Dan Olsen directly into your AI agent's workflow.

## What Is PM-Skills?

Generic AI gives you text. **PM-Skills gives you structure.**

Each skill encodes a proven product management framework — discovery, assumption mapping, prioritization, strategy — and walks your AI agent through it step by step. You get the rigor of industry-standard PM methodologies built into your daily workflow, not sitting on a bookshelf.

The result: better product decisions, not just faster documents.

PM-Skills uses three abstractions:

- **Skills** — Reusable PM knowledge (frameworks, templates, analytical tools). Loaded automatically when relevant to a conversation.
- **Commands** — User-triggered workflows (`/discover`, `/write-prd`, `/strategy`) that chain multiple skills into end-to-end processes.
- **Plugins** — Installable packages grouping related skills and commands by PM domain.

Commands are designed to flow into each other, matching the real PM workflow. After any command completes, it suggests relevant next commands.

**GitHub:** [phuryn/pm-skills](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-skills) · **Stars:** 2,400+ · **License:** MIT · **Language:** Markdown/Shell

## Installation

### Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add phuryn/pm-skills

# Step 2: Install individual plugins
claude plugin install pm-toolkit@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-product-strategy@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-product-discovery@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-market-research@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-data-analytics@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-marketing-growth@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-go-to-market@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-execution@pm-skills
claude plugin install pm-ai-shipping@pm-skills
```

### Claude Cowork (For Non-Developers)

1. Open **Customize** (bottom-left)
2. Go to **Browse plugins** → **Personal** → **+**
3. Select **Add marketplace from GitHub**
4. Enter: `phuryn/pm-skills`

All 9 plugins install automatically with both commands and skills.

### Codex CLI (OpenAI)

Codex reads the same plugin marketplace file as Claude Code:

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
codex plugin marketplace add phuryn/pm-skills

# Step 2: Install the plugins you want
codex plugin add pm-toolkit@pm-skills
codex plugin add pm-product-strategy@pm-skills
# ... etc
```

**Note:** Codex plugins don't expose `/slash` commands. To run workflows, describe the steps in plain language:

> Run product discovery on [your idea]: brainstorm options, map assumptions, prioritize the risky ones, then design experiments — pause between each step.

Optionally, ask Codex to convert command files into equivalent skills for the workflows you use most.

### Other AI Assistants (Skills Only)

The `skills/*/SKILL.md` files follow the universal skill format and work with any tool that reads them. Commands (`/slash-commands`) are Claude-specific.

| Tool | How to Use | What Works |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Gemini CLI | Copy skill folders to `.gemini/skills/` | Skills only |
| OpenCode | Copy skill folders to `.opencode/skills/` | Skills only |
| Cursor | Copy skill folders to `.cursor/skills/` | Skills only |
| Kiro | Copy skill folders to `.kiro/skills/` | Skills only |

```bash
# Example: copy all skills for OpenCode (project-level)
for plugin in pm-*/; do
  mkdir -p .opencode/skills/
  cp -r "$plugin/skills/"* .opencode/skills/ 2>/dev/null
done

# Example: copy all skills for Gemini CLI (global)
for plugin in pm-*/; do
  cp -r "$plugin/skills/"* ~/.gemini/skills/ 2>/dev/null
done
```

**Skills** are loaded automatically when relevant to the conversation — no explicit invocation needed. To force-load skills: `/plugin-name:skill-name` or `/skill-name`.

**Commands** chain one or more skills into end-to-end processes. For example, `/discover` chains: `brainstorm-ideas → identify-assumptions → prioritize-assumptions → brainstorm-experiments`.

**Plugins** group related skills and commands into installable packages. Installing the marketplace gives you all 9 plugins at once.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to install all 9 plugins?

No. Install only the plugins relevant to your workflow. Most PMs will start with `pm-product-discovery`, `pm-execution`, and `pm-product-strategy`.

### Q: Can I use PM-Skills without Claude Code?

Yes. The skills directory (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) follows the universal skill format and works with Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Kiro, and any tool that reads SKILL.md files. Commands (`/slash-commands`) are Claude-specific.

### Q: How are skills loaded?

Skills load automatically when relevant to the conversation. You can also force-load a skill with `/plugin-name:skill-name` or `/skill-name`.

### Q: What's the difference between skills and commands?

Skills are building blocks — individual frameworks, templates, or analytical tools. Commands are user-triggered workflows that chain multiple skills together into end-to-end processes.

### Q: Is this free?

Yes. PM-Skills is MIT licensed. No tracking, no analytics, no cloud dependency. Everything runs locally.

### Q: What is PM Brain?

[PM Brain](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-brain) is a companion project — a second brain for product managers. Plain markdown files on your laptop. Claude reads them before answering, writes to them after, sweeps them every Friday. No vector DB, no cloud, no agent memory tricks.

## Writing Custom Skills

You can extend PM-Skills with your own custom skills. Create a `SKILL.md` file in the `skills/` directory:

```markdown
---
name: my-company-framework
mode: inline
---

# My Company Product Framework

When working on product decisions for our company, follow this framework:

1. Validate the problem with at least 3 customer interviews
2. Build an Opportunity Solution Tree
3. Design a pretotype before building
4. Measure against our North Star metric
```

Test your custom skill with:

```bash
# Force-load your custom skill
/my-company-framework Brainstorm monetization for our analytics dashboard
```

## Full Discovery Workflow Example

Here's a complete discovery workflow using PM-Skills commands in sequence:

```
# Step 1: Generate ideas
/discover AI-powered code review tool for small teams

# Step 2: Map assumptions
/identify-assumptions-existing
→ Value: Will devs actually use AI suggestions?
→ Feasibility: Can we integrate with GitHub API reliably?

# Step 3: Prioritize
/prioritize-assumptions
→ Highest risk: Value assumption (low confidence)

# Step 4: Design experiments
/brainstorm-experiments-existing
→ Pretotype: Manual concierge test with 5 beta users
→ Survey: NPS + feature importance ranking
```
